# Assets
The graphics are mostly taken from [Kenney's Pixel Platformer pack](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer), with some self-made. The assets have been turned green by [the greeninator material](greeninator.material) to make it look more retro.

The font is Public Pixel by GGBotNet.

The sound effects are from [Driken5482 on pixabay](https://pixabay.com/users/45721595).

The music is Bit Beats {1,3} from [XtremeFreddy](https://pixabay.com/users/xtremefreddy-32332307) (please check them out on pixabay and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@xtremefreddy), they're really talented and not as popular as they should be).
